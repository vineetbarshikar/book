## Why have the individual lectures been removed from the resources section?

We identified that someone after almost three weeks has not looked at
the ePub and missed valuable information. To force students to look at
the epub we have removed the direct links to the md files in piazza
`Resources` section. Instead we still leave the links to the md file
sin the syllabus so that you can still get to them from the syllabus.
This way also room for error is minimized as we only have to update
one file wit the location and not two.

The little clouds in the ePub are automatically created and provide
a direct link to the md file for which the content follows.

Essentially instead of making it real convenient not to read the epub,
we make it now real convenient that you read it while *hiding* the
inks a bit in the syllabus md file.

## urls in markdown
urls must be wrapped in markdown


example  [text](url) or <url> work


but just


url


does not

## markdown: use star instead of underscore
As we do some translations of the markdown, we noticed that whan you use _ instead of * in your markdown this may lead to issues. please use


```
*italic*
and
**bold**
```

## Opening Epub properly in Linux
We recently noticed that not all the symbols, which are pretty important, are visible when we open the Epub in Linux using Calibre.

Before trying to putting time on fixing the Calibre, I tried couple of other software and seems like  Bookworm can open the Epub correctly. I tried this in Ubuntu 18.04 (unity). You can follow the instructions here for installing Bookworm.

## Microsoft Edge for Epub
On Windows 10 you need to have version 42.17134 for edge to properly display an epub.

## Project format: Markdown allowed
I have been working with some students on using Markdown for the format of the project report and it turns out to be possible to write your project report in markdown.



Hence, you have the option to use Markdown or LaTeX. We still use bibtex for management of the references in markdown.



tips for use of markdown for project report writing:


```
labels for citation in markdown are [@label]
```

use of commands

````md
```bash
$ ls
```
````

use of python

````md
```python
print("hello")
```
````

do not use quotes when you ought to use italics: This technology is called "docker" is wrong, but this technology is called *docker* is right.
Use # to manage your sections not underscores or = this way you can easier count if indentation level is right
There must only be the title with one #
images are included as documented in our notation.md file of the lecture notes
Do not use the words below and above, as the images can float and below and above makes ABSOLUTELY NO SENSE when referring to images if you do not know the final format where the images will be placed   which is the case for us. Figures must be mentioned in the text explicitly. e.g. as shown in +@fig:figlabel
you can use pandoc locally to make sure bibs and figures show up corretcly.

## pull request in documents from commandline
I updated a section in the github section called



“25.5.17 Contributing to the Document”



The problem is neither the TAs or I can test it as our permissions are different. Would someone with github knowledge be so kind to test that section and improve so others can replicate this?



It may actually work, but I have not tested it. Improvement suggestions are welcome.

There is lots of documentation about this on the github.com web page also,


If you are forking a repo, it's better to keep your master branch clean. Meaning that there won't be any changes done on your master branch itself. It will be the branch that you sync with the upstream repo (the cloudmesh repo).



Hence, if you are doing any changes, it's better to do it in a branch in your own repo. Then if there are conflicts, you can resolve them on your own repo first when rebasing (syncing your dev branch with the upstream master).



Ex:



Let's say you are working on the file ref.bib.

You are keeping the master of your repo in sync and working on a branch called dev-ref. But when you try to push, you finds out that there's already a new change in the upstream master for the same file.



Then what you do is, first sync your master. Then you do a rebase for your branch to get the branch up to date with the latest changes (your synced master). Once rebased (fixing the conflicts), then you can send the pull request from your branch to the upstream repo.


It's always better to keep your master clean for the rebase to be easier on your fork.

## pyenv installed but can not find python
We recommend that you read the section that comes immediately after the pyenv install section. It comments on how to install python with pyenv. pyenv by itself does not come with python, it is a tool to install python. Yo naturally have to install the version you want to use.

## ssh add/keychoain on OSX
There is lots of information in the lecture notes on SSH I strongly recommend you read it. However, I saw some people struggle with SSH keychain on OSX. Here some tips on how to make it work on OSX which I found on the Web.



1. Start the ssh-agent in the background.
```
eval "$(ssh-agent -s)"
Agent pid 59566
```

2. Use `~/.ssh/config` file to automatically load keys into the ssh-agent and store passphrases in your keychain. Add the following to the file:
```
Host *
 AddKeysToAgent yes
 UseKeychain yes
 IdentityFile ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

3. Add your SSH private key to the ssh-agent and store your passphrase in the keychain. If you created your key with a different name, or if you are adding an existing key that has a different name, replace id_rsa in the command with the name of your private key file. Note the -K is OSX specific and means you will use keychain to manage your key
```
ssh-add -K ~/.ssh/id_rsa
```

## Citations in markdown
The ebooks have a ./bib dir. IN this you find a lot of references in bibtex format (see Scientific Writing II). Bibtex can be easily managed with emacs or jabref. There are other tools also.



You can place a file in the bib folder



references-fa18-516-000.bib (use your hid)

put the refernces in there



Then you can cite them in the text with



[@bibtexkey]



Example:


```
@MIsc{www-google,

   author={{Google}},

   title={Google Home Page},

   howpublished={Web page},

   url={https://google.com}

}
```


Now you can use:



A good way to search on the internet is to use [Google)[https://google.com][@www-google]

## hyperreferences to other sections in markdown
```
# This is my header {#s-this-is-my-label}
```

Now, I can refer to [Section](#s-this-is-my-label)


## code in markdown
When using code in markdoen we recommend using


````md
```
code
```
````
It is easier to manage, we may even experiment with


````md
``` python
code
```
````
to see if syntax highlighting works. I have not tried this yet though



When doing bash, we also like to try


````md
``` bash
$ script
```
````

## check into github early!
All:



there is no such thing as to check your things in github early. In fact that is good as than others can contribute early including me if I have time. A good example is the vagrant code where a student made the wise decision to check it in and someone (in this case me) contributed. As you can see through teamwork we can achieve a lot.



So do not be embarrassed if your code needs to have improvements



In the cm folder when you work on things just create an incoming directory and put your code in a subfolder if it is not yet integrated. We will set up a library structure soon.



I just spoke to a student who thought his code was not yet good enough. But my oppinion is any code is good enough .... as it allows others to contribute early

## I want to start my project now.
We have provided you with a concrete assignment of developing a python program. This program, can be used as part of you project. I advise you that if you like to start on your project now. TO start with the development of this program. We will enhance this program so that the project can benefit from it.

You should spend your time learning about python and setting up your environment. Using VirtualBox will come in handy when we start managing virtual machines from the command line.
