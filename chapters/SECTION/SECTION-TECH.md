# [Bigdata Technologies and Algorithms]{.part}

In this section we will introduce you to additional technologies and
algorithms frequently associated with Big Data. Previously we already
introduced you to topics such as

* Recommender SYstems as shown in Section [Recommender Systems](#s-recommender)
* k Nearest Neighbour as shown in Section [kNN](#s-knn)

We introduce you here to plotviz that allows us to display large
numbers of points in 3D, as well as k-means.
